# Test My Skills
## At adding a file to an existing repo
### In this case datasciencecoursera

These are the steps I am going to follow:

* create and save the file (this one!)
* git add test_my_skills.md
* git commit -m "Adding a file to test myself!"
* git push origin master

See if it worked by going to GitHub ...
